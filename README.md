## Analog clock with sensor info for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense
### [Get this clock face from the Fitbit Gallery](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/3c0ff5ad-50e7-4943-bdcd-f7521ef8e82b)
This is a modern, formal clock face, with date, weather, sunset/sunrise, and sensor information. The background color can be changed in the settings (I originally conceived of this design as being blue, hence the name. Then I realized it would be fun to change the color to suit your mood/clothing/whatever). Tapping the sensor icon cycles through the available sensors.

Included sensors are: 
+ Battery
+ Heart Rate
+ Steps
+ Distance
+ Active Zone Minutes

The clock face can also be switched from round to square in the settings.
